## 📄 Abstract

This paper presents a structural field model based on **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)** that explains previously anomalous behaviors in black hole mergers—such as asymmetric jets, prolonged ringdowns, and repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs)—as the result of *merger frustration*. 

In the QSD framework, black hole unification is not guaranteed. Misalignment in internal phase, rotational shear, or substrate coherence can trap the system in a dual-core metastable state—a *black hole molecule*. This configuration, separated by a *coherence trench*, acts as an emission engine producing scalar bursts and directional jets without requiring accretion.

By modeling the internal dynamics using phase-structured coherence physics (rather than geometric singularities), QSD offers a falsifiable, Lorentz-invariant explanation for a wide array of astrophysical observations.

## 🧠 What is Merger Frustration?

In classical GR, black hole mergers are assumed inevitable once the horizons meet. In QSD:

- **Mass** is a phase-locked lattice of coherence
- **Inertia** is substrate drag (coherence reconfiguration resistance)
- **Gravity** is a tension gradient in the substrate field

### Merger frustration occurs when:
- Spin axes and rotational frequencies are misaligned
- Coherence wavefronts interfere destructively
- Substrate saturation prevents yield overlap

Instead of merging, the system stabilizes into a **dual-core molecule**, emitting structured jet and scalar signals via the trench region.

## 🔍 Observational Alignment

Predictions of the model match features seen in:

- **GW190814**: asymmetric post-merger structure
- **M87**: stable jet with no accretion disk
- **SS 433**: jet precession without classic merger profile
- **FRB 180916**: periodic scalar-like bursts

## 🧪 Scientific Foundations

This work builds on the core framework of **Quantum Substrate Dynamics (QSD)**, a Lorentz-invariant field model in which:

- Mass arises from saturated coherence nodes
- Merger conditions are dictated by phase resonance (VFC – Vibrational Fusion Condition)
- Scalar waves are longitudinal coherence-pressure pulses
- Black holes are not singularities, but phase-locked regions of the substrate
